# File name index2.js

* This is a Node.js application that uses the Express.js framework to create a web server. It also uses the Azure AI Content Safety service to analyze text for potentially unsafe content. Here’s a breakdown of what the code does:

Imports Required Modules: The application imports necessary modules such as express for creating the server, @azure-rest/ai-content-safety for content safety analysis, and @azure/core-auth for authentication.

Environment Variables: It loads environment variables from a .env file using dotenv. These variables include the port number for the server and the endpoint and key for the Azure AI Content Safety service.

Express App Setup: It creates an Express application, sets up middleware to serve static files from the ‘public’ directory, and parses JSON request bodies.

POST ‘/analyze’ Endpoint: This is the main part of the application. It defines a POST endpoint at ‘/analyze’ that:

Extracts the text from the request body.
Creates a new instance of ContentSafetyClient using the endpoint and key from the environment variables.
Sends a POST request to the /text:analyze path of the Content Safety service with the text to be analyzed.
If the request is successful (HTTP status 200), it maps the categories analysis from the response body to a simpler format and sends this back in the response.
If the request fails, it throws an error and sends a response with HTTP status 500 and the error message.
Server Start: Finally, it starts the server on the specified port and logs a message to the console.

This application could be used as part of a content moderation system, analyzing user-submitted text for potentially unsafe content and categorizing it based on severity. The categories could then be used to decide whether to allow, block, or review the content.
